# Methodology

> RMWC is intended to be an un-opinionated React wrapper around [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/)

## Project Goals

* To create the thinnest, lightest, and spec compliant wrapper around Google
  Material Design Components for the Web
  [https://material.io/components/web/](https://material.io/components/web/)
* To utilize the Foundation javascript classes from material-components-web
* To be as unobtrusive and sensible as possible.
* To fill the gaps in material-components-web with custom React community driven components.

## Why?

There are many different Material UI implementations in both Angular and React. The last thing we need is another one... In React land there has been a lot of great work done, but you eventually end up in one of the following situations:

* The library is heavy or extremely inflexible (crazy api, opinionated styling)
* The library is an opinionated representation of material or it isn't very polished
* The library has been abandoned

RMWC's goal is to use the Google sanctioned javascript Material Design Components which are designed, developed, and maintained by Google. Where Google doesn't provide a component, RMWC will include its own React driven components. These will be denoted with an "RMWC Addon" label.

## Breaking Changes

The goal of the project is to have ZERO breaking changes and rely heavily on deprecations between major versions. While its a novel goal, in practice it is quite difficult. `material-components-web` (in classic Google fashion) was in alpha for 2 years and contained a litany of brekaing changes along the way. Since adopting an official 1.0.0 breaking changes have been reduced, but still exist.

As of the 5.x.x version RMWC, the apis have stablizied for the foreseeable future and intensive work has been done to make sure that breaking changes are limited in scope and obey semver rules. Where possible, deprecations will be used, and you can count on deprecations being valid until the next major version. If you are using Typescript, your IDE will not tell you the properties are deprecated, but your runtime compiled code, as well as the comments in your IDE will say "DEPRECATED" across the top. 

The good news is, since components are indiviudally packaged and released, you can generally safely upgrade a components one at a time.

So to sum it up:

- RMWC works hard to minimize breaking changes between releases
- Deprecations are favored over breaking changes. These will be logged out anytime NODE_ENV !== 'production'
- Any breaking change will honor semver and bump a major version
- Minor versions are used for releases that contain new features but no breaking changes
- Patch versions are for bugfixes

## Basic Layout

Material Components web uses BEM syntax to style and script their components. RMWC directly inherits MDC's naming conventions, so if you can read one, you can infer the other.

Block -> Component
Element -> Components / Children
Modifier -> Props

Here's a TextField example in raw MDC and with RMWC.

```jsx
// The example is from material-components-web
<ul class="mdc-list mdc-list--two-line">
  <li class="mdc-list-item">
    <span class="mdc-list-item__text">
      Two-line item
      <span class="mdc-list-item__secondary-text">Secondary text</span>
    </span>
  </li>
</ul>
```

```jsx
// This is the RMWC version
<List twoLine>
  <ListItem>
    <ListItemPrimaryText>
      Two-line item
    </ListItemPrimaryText>
    <ListItemSecondaryText>Secondary text</ListItemSecondaryText>
  </ListItem>
</List>
```

## Convenience

Even though this is meant to be an un-opinionated wrapper, in some areas decisions had to be made to improve utility and the overall developer experience. At the end of the day, if it doesn't make your life easier, what's the point?

## Something missing from RMWC?

RMWC wraps the entire [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) package in React, but because they are different projects with different maintainers, sometimes things can be missed. A lot of components from [material-components-web](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web) don't require javascript. For these, you can simply use the classNames in your own project. Of course, RMWC wants to cover the entire codebase, so if you see something missing or incorrect, please [file an issue](https://github.com/rmwc/rmwc/issues/new).

```jsx
/** This will give you a CSS only button and skip RMWC all together */
<button className="mdc-button" />
```
